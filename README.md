# RFM_Analysis_for_Customer_Segmentation
## Project Overview:
This project focused on using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis with SQL to group customers based on their buying habits. RFM analysis breaks down customer habits into three main factors: how recently they made a purchase, how often they buy, and how much they spend. This helps businesses to understand customer's shopping behaviors and identify the most valuable customers, making it easier to target them with the right marketing strategies.

## RFM Calculation:
- **Recency**: Determining how many days have passed since each customer's last purchase.
- **Frequency**: Counting how many purchases each customer has made over a certain period.
- **Monetary**: Calculating the total amount of money spent by each customer.

## Customer Segmentation:
Customers were divided into groups based on their RFM scores. This helps businesses understand which customers are most valuable and which might need extra attention. Analyzing each customer group provided insights into their behaviors and preferences. This information is used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. The Customers after through analysis were devided into following segments,
- **Lost Customers**: The Customers who haven't bought anything in quite some time and have lost their Loyalty.
- **Slipping Customers**: The Customers who are purchesing less often, spending less money and not interacting as much as they used to.
- **New Customers**: The Customers who have purchased for the first time recently and are interacting frequently since then.
- **Active Customers**: The Customers who regularly purchase and are actively interacting demonstrating loyalty.

## Problem Statements:
- Calculate RFM scores for each customer based on their transaction history.
- Calculate the Total Revenue generated in each Year and each Month.
- Segment customers into different groups based on their RFM scores.
- Identify Top Customers by RFM segments.
- Identify Top Selling Products.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Using SQL to analyze data and extract useful information.
- Turning complex data into simple insights for business decisions.

## Conclusion:
This project shows how using RFM analysis and SQL can help businesses understand their customers and grow better. It highlights the importance of using data to make smart decisions and keep customers happy. The feedbacks taken from **Lost Customers** can help to identify the gap between demand and supply. New strategies must be implemented to retain the **slipping customers** by providing special offers, by improving the Customer Service, by enhancing the product or servie value, and by providing additional support. Effective strategies must be implemented for the **New Customers** because they represent potential growth for business and may become loyal customers if they have a positive experience.
