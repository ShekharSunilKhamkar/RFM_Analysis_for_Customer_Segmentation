# RFM_Analysis_for_Customer_Segmentation
## Project Overview:
This project focused on using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis with SQL to group customers based on their buying habits. RFM analysis breaks down customer habits into three main factors: how recently they made a purchase, how often they buy, and how much they spend. This helps businesses to understand customer's shopping behaviors and identify the most valuable customers, making it easier to target them with the right marketing strategies.

## RFM Calculation:
- Recency: Determining how many days have passed since each customer's last purchase.
- Frequency: Counting how many purchases each customer has made over a certain period.
- Monetary Value: Calculating the total amount of money spent by each customer.
